### Description

Searching for and downloading torrents over a VPN, converting them to the correct format, renaming them so media services can pick up their correct metadata, and organizing them within your file system can be a tedious and very manual process. We should have a tool that can run on a local computer or media server which can automate the bulk of this process.

### Expected Results

-   Automated software for managing torrent downloads
-   Web app for managing torrent subscriptions and settings
