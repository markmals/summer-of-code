title: Swift Language Mode for Astro
size: 2 months
difficulty: Hard

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

**Project size**: 2 months

**Estimated difficulty**: Hard


### Recommended Skills

* Proficency in Swift
* Familiarity with the Node.js ecosystem
* Familiarity with Golang, in which the Astro compiler is written

### Description

From [@nmoo@mas.to](https://mas.to/@nmoo/109745121968494808), Astro core team member:

<blockquote>

Fun fact about the [@astro](https://m.webtoo.ls/@astro) compiler! It is *technically* language agnostic, meaning there's no requirement that frontmatter or expressions must use TypeScript/JavaScript.

The following code would parse just fine, although it wouldn't actually run unless we added support for Rust output.

```astro
---
let latin1: &[u8] = b"\xA1Hello world!";
println!("{:?}", utf8);
---

<h1>{latin1.iter().cloned().map(char::from).collect()}</h1>
```

</blockquote>

What if we did that, but for Swift? Write Swift on the backend and HTML/CSS/front-end JavaScript frameworks for the front-end. Should make for a really fast website that is very compatible with your iOS app's data model...

```astro title="Trips.astro"
---
// import Countdown ?

let upcomingTrips = FetchDescriptor<Trip>(
    predicate: #Predicate { $0.startDate > Date.now },
    sortBy: [.init(\.startDate)]
)

upcomingTrips.fetchLimit = 50
upcomingTrips.includePendingChanges = true

let results = await container.mainContext.fetch(upcomingTrips)
---

<h1>Trips</h1>
{results.map { trip in
    <h2>{trip.name}</h2>
    <Countdown until={trip.startDate.formatted(.iso8601)}>
}}
```

{/* h2 { trip.name }
span { "Starts on: " }
time { trip.startDate.formatted(.dateTime.day().month(.wide).year()) } */}


{/* <h2>{trip.name}</h2>
<span>Starts on: <span>
<time>{trip.startDate.formatted(.dateTime.day().month(.wide).year())}</time> */}


### Expected Results

* Fork of the Astro compiler and runtime that can process Swift in frontmatter and expressions in Astro templates, along with server-rendered JavaScript frameworks
* Vite plugin infrastructure to integrate Swift
* Example website using Astro Swift to demonstrate the technology
